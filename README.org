Figuring out how to implement your ML project? Learn from *how other
organizations have done it*:

- *How* the problem is framed üîé(e.g., personalization as recsys
  vs.¬†search vs.¬†sequences)
- *What* machine learning techniques worked ‚úÖ (and sometimes, what
  didn't ‚ùå)
- *Why* it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and
  references üìÇ
- *What* real-world results were achieved (so you can better assess ROI
